mov eax, [ebx+esi*4+0x10]

This instruction attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, the product of ESI and 4, and 0x10.  The problem arises if ESI is exceptionally large, causing an integer overflow before the calculation of the final address.  This overflow might lead to an access violation or other unpredictable behavior because the resulting address will be incorrect, pointing to a memory location outside the intended range.
